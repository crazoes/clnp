1. Check out the complete source tree.

2. Copy ``pwd`/include/linux/*.h' and ``pwd`/include/net/*.h' to
   `/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/linux/' and
   `/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/net/', respectively.

3. Add `#define AF_ATN 29' and `#define PF_ATN AF_ATN' to
   `/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/linux/socket.h' and
   `/usr/include/bits/socket.h', respectively, as follows:

   For Linux kernel in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/linux/socket.h:
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   /* Supported address families. */
   ...
   #define AF_WANPIPE      25      /* Wanpipe API Sockets */
   #define AF_LLC          26      /* Linux LLC                    */
   #define AF_ATN          29      /* ATN TP4/CLNP Networking Suite */
   #define AF_TIPC         30      /* TIPC sockets                 */
   #define AF_BLUETOOTH    31      /* Bluetooth sockets            */
   ...

   /* Protocol families, same as address families. */
   ...
   #define PF_WANPIPE      AF_WANPIPE
   #define PF_LLC          AF_LLC
   #define PF_ATN          AF_ATN
   #define PF_TIPC         AF_TIPC
   #define PF_BLUETOOTH    AF_BLUETOOTH
   ...

   For GNU C library in /usr/include/bits/socket.h:
   ------------------------------------------------
   /* Protocol families.  */
   ...
   #define PF_WANPIPE      25      /* Wanpipe API sockets.  */
   #define PF_ATN          29      /* ATN TP4/CLNP Networking Suite */
   #define PF_BLUETOOTH    31      /* Bluetooth sockets.  */
   ...

   /* Address families.  */
   ...
   #define AF_WANPIPE      PF_WANPIPE
   #define AF_ATN          PF_ATN
   #define AF_BLUETOOTH    PF_BLUETOOTH
   ...

4. Add a directory named `netatn' in /usr/include/.
   Copy the following data to a file named `atn.h' put in the directory.

5. Make sure you are in the directory containing the source code.
   Execute `make' to build `atn.ko'.
   You can opt to execute `make modules_install' instead so that the resulting
   `atn.ko' will be put in your system.
   Later, execute `make clean' to clean up every generated files.

6. Make sure that `register_8022_client' and `unregister_8022_client' symbols
   can be found in your Linux kernel. To do so, execute:
   `cat /proc/kallsyms | grep register_8022_client'. If those two symbols are
   returned, you can continue to the next step. Otherwise, you have to build one
   of the following Linux kernel components either as a module or built-in into
   the kernel. If it has already been built as a module, make sure that it has
   been inserted into the running kernel with either `modprobe' or `insmod':
   Networking -> Networking options -> 802.1d Ethernet Bridging
   Networking -> Networking options -> ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 Support
   Networking -> Networking options -> The IPX protocol
   Networking -> Networking options -> Appletalk protocol support
   Device drivers -> Network device support -> Token Ring devices
                                                    -> Token Ring driver support

7. Make sure you are in the directory containing the source code.
   If you executed `make modules_install', execute `modprobe atn.ko' to insert
   the module. Otherwise, execute `insmod atn.ko'.
   Later, execute `rmmod atn' to remove the module.
